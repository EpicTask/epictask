# Frontend Service Technical Design

## Architecture
The Frontend service follows a single-page application (SPA) architecture using the Nuxt.js framework. It leverages Vue.js as the underlying JavaScript framework to build interactive and responsive user interfaces. The application is rendered on the client-side, reducing server load and providing a smooth user experience.

### API Integration
The Frontend service communicates with the backend services through RESTful API calls. It utilizes the Axios library to handle HTTP requests and responses. These API calls are responsible for retrieving and updating data related to tasks, user management, and authentication. The service interacts with the backend services to ensure seamless integration and real-time data synchronization.

### State Management
To manage the application's state and enable efficient data sharing between components, the Frontend service utilizes Vuex, which is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications. Vuex centralizes the application's state, making it easily accessible and modifiable by different components. It helps maintain consistency and allows for efficient data retrieval and updates.

### Styling and UI Framework
The Frontend service uses Vuetify, a popular Material Design component framework for Vue.js applications. Vuetify provides a set of pre-designed UI components, layout grids, and styling guidelines, enabling rapid development and consistent UI design. It enhances the application's aesthetics and responsiveness while ensuring a cohesive user experience across different devices.

## Integration with Other Services
The Frontend service interacts with various backend services to provide a comprehensive user experience. It communicates with the Task Management service to retrieve and update task-related information, the User Management service for user authentication and authorization, and the Verification service to verify completed transactions if applicable.

## Deployment and Scalability
The Frontend service is deployed separately from the backend services and can be hosted on a static file hosting service or a container hosting platform. It can be easily scaled horizontally to handle increased user traffic by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer. Additionally, the service benefits from the scalability and resilience features provided by the underlying infrastructure, such as Cloud Run or a similar platform.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).


### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/store).
