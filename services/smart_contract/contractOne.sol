This test smart contract allows users to create tasks and have them completed by other users. 
The tasks are stored in an escrow account until they are completed. When the task is completed, 
the smart contract pays the worker the agreed-upon amount, adjusted for changes in the price of XRP.

Example on how to use this smart contract:

User A creates a task and specifies the amount of XRP they are willing to pay for it.
User B accepts the task.
User A deposits the agreed-upon amount of XRP into an escrow account.
User B completes the task.
The smart contract pays User B the agreed-upon amount, adjusted for changes in the price of XRP.
This smart contract can be used to create a fair and efficient way to hire workers to complete tasks. 
The smart contract ensures that the workers are paid the agreed-upon amount, even if the price of XRP changes. 
This can help to protect the workers from losses due to fluctuations in the price of XRP.

  // This function creates a new task.

    }

    // Send the XRP to the worker.

    // Calculate the value of the XRP in dollars when the task was created.
    uint256 createdValue = createdPrice * escrowAmount;
