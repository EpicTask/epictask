# Verification Service

The Verification Service is an API-based system that utilizes AI models to verify task completion. It provides a seamless integration of AI models for verification purposes, allowing users to submit tasks for verification and receive the verification results. Verifi has the potential to serve as a business in of itself. XRP payments can be utilized to monetized users that submit models to handle specific use cases. This can be facilitated through hooks/smart contracts and M2M payments.

## API Design and Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for the verification system:

- `POST /verify_task`: Submit a verification request for a task. Include the task data and task type as parameters in the request.
- `POST /select-model`: Select the best AI model based on the task requirements and the available models.
- `POST /model_requirements`: Check the requirements of the selected AI model and conform the task data accordingly.
- `POST /execute-model`: Execute the selected AI model with the conformant task data for verification.
- `GET /models/{verification_type}`: Retrieve the available AI models for a specific verification type.
- `GET /result/{task_id}`: Retrieve the verification result for a specific task ID.

## Task Type and Verification Type

The verification system supports the following task types but not limited to:

- Image Recognition
- Text Analysis
- Fraud Detection

Each task type corresponds to specific verification types, which hold the AI models associated with that verification type. For example:

- Image Recognition:
  - Verification Type: "image_recognition"
  - AI Models: "model_1", "model_2", "model_3"

- Text Analysis:
  - Verification Type: "text_analysis"
  - AI Models: "model_a", "model_b", "model_c"

- Fraud Detection:
  - Verification Type: "fraud_detection"
  - AI Models: "model_x", "model_y", "model_z"

## Model Selection

When a verification request is received, the system checks the task type and chooses the appropriate verification type. It then retrieves the available AI models for that verification type. A model selection algorithm is implemented to choose the best model based on factors such as accuracy, performance, and availability.

## Model ID Retrieval

The model ID of the selected AI model for the given verification request is obtained. The system maintains a mapping of model IDs to their respective models and their requirements, including input format, output format, and dependencies.

## Model Requirements Checking

The system checks the requirements of the selected AI model for the given task. It validates and conforms the task data to match the input format and any specific requirements of the model. Any necessary data preprocessing or transformation is performed to ensure compatibility.

## Model Execution

The selected AI model is executed using the conformant task data. The system leverages the AI model's API or library to process the task data and perform the verification. The output or result generated by the model is captured.

## Result Retrieval

The verification result is returned as the response to the API caller. The response is structured to include the outcome of the verification, additional metadata, and relevant details of the AI model used for verification. This information provides insights into the verification process and the model's characteristics.

## Testing and Documentation

The verification system is thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and reliability. Unit tests and integration tests are implemented to validate the system's components and interactions. Comprehensive documentation is available for the API, including detailed descriptions of the endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples. This documentation aids developers in integrating with the verification service effectively.
